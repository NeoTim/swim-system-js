The **@swim/system** umbrella framework provides a standalone set of frameworks
for building massively real-time streaming WARP clients and web user interface
applications.  **@swim/system** encompasses the
[**@swim/core**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/swim-core-js)
foundation framework, the
[**@swim/mesh**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/swim-mesh-js)
multiplexed streaming WARP framework, the
[**@swim/ui**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/swim-ui-js)
and [**@swim/ux**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/swim-ux-js)
real-time user interface toolkits, and the
[**@swim/web**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/swim-web-js)
real-time web application framework.

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/system` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/system/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/system/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script, which
bundles all **@swim/system** child frameworks, can be found in
`node_modules/@swim/system/dist/main/swim-system.js`.

### Browser

Browser applications can load `swim-system.js` directly from the Swim CDN.
The `swim-system.js` bundle is self-contained; it supersedes `swim-core.js`,
`swim-mesh.js`, `swim-ui.js`, `swim-ux.js`, and `swim-web.js`—those scripts
need not be loaded when using `swim-system.js`.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.swim.ai/js/latest/swim-system.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

**@swim/system** can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.  All child framework libraries are re-exported
by the umbrella `@swim/system` module.

```typescript
import * as swim from "@swim/system";
```

### CommonJS/Node.js

**@swim/system** can also be used as a CommonJS module in Node.js applications.
All child framework libraries are re-exported by the umbrella `@swim/system`
module.

```javascript
var swim = require("@swim/system");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-system.js` script adds all child
framework exports to the global `swim` namespace.
