The **Swim System** umbrella framework provides a standalone set of frameworks
for building massively real-time streaming WARP clients and web user interface
applications.  **Swim System** encompasses the [**Swim Core**](swim-core-js)
foundation framework, the [**Swim Mesh**](swim-mesh-js) multiplexed streaming
WARP framework, the [**Swim UI**](swim-ui-js) and [**Swim UX**](swim-ux-js)
real-time user interface toolkits, and the [**Swim Web**](swim-web-js)
real-time web application framework.

## **Umbrella Framework**

The **Swim System** umbrella framework has no external dependencies when run
in a web browser, and depends only on a WebSocket implementation when run in
Node.js.  **Swim System** provides the following top-level libraries:

- [**@swim/system**](@swim/system) –
  umbrella package that depends on, and re-exports, all **Swim System**
  child frameworks and libraries.

### [**Swim Core Framework**](swim-core-js)

The **Swim Core** framework provides a lightweight, portable, dependency-free,
and strongly typed baseline on which to build higher level libraries.
**Swim Core** consists of the following component libraries:

  umbrella package that depends on, and re-exports, all **Swim Core** libraries.

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/system` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/system/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/system/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script, which
bundles all **@swim/system** child frameworks, can be found in
`node_modules/@swim/system/dist/main/swim-system.js`.

### Browser

Browser applications can load `swim-system.js` directly from the Swim CDN.
The `swim-system.js` bundle is self-contained; it supersedes `swim-core.js`,
`swim-mesh.js`, `swim-ui.js`, `swim-ux.js`, and `swim-web.js`—those scripts
need not be loaded when using `swim-system.js`.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

**@swim/system** can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.  All child frameworks are re-exported by
the umbrella `@swim/system` module.

```typescript
import * as swim from "@swim/system";
```

### CommonJS/Node.js

**@swim/system** can also be used as a CommonJS module in Node.js applications.
All child frameworks are re-exported by the umbrella `@swim/system` module.

```javascript
var swim = require("@swim/system");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-system.js` script adds all child
framework exports to the global `swim` namespace.

## Development

### Setup

Install build dependencies:

```sh
swim-system-js $ npm install
```

### Compiling sources

Use the `compile` build script command to compile, bundle, and minify
TypeScript sources into JavaScript universal module definitions, output
to the `dist` subdirectory of each project.  To compile all targets,
of all projects, run:

```sh
swim-system-js $ bin/build.js compile
```

To compile a subset of projects and targets, include a `--projects` (`-p`)
option, with a comma-separated list of `$project:($target)?` specifiers.
For example, to build the `main` target of the `core` project, and all
targets of the `ui` project, run:

```sh
swim-system-js $ bin/build.js compile -p core:main,ui
```

### Running tests

Use the `test` build script command to compile and run unit tests.
For example, to compile and test the `ui` project, run:

```sh
swim-system-js $ bin/build.js test -p ui
```

### Continuous development builds

Use the `watch` build script command to automatically rebuild projects when
dependent source files change.  For example, to continuously recompile the
`main` target of the `ux` project when any source file in the project–or in
one of the project's transitive local dependencies–changes, run:

```sh
swim-system-js $ bin/build.js watch -p ux:main
```

Pass the `--devel` (`-d`) option to expedite recompilation by skipping the
minification step.  Add the `--test` (`-t`) option to automatically run unit
tests after each successful compilation.  For example, to continuosly compile
and test the `ui` project, bypassing minification, and skipping generation of
the main script, run:

```sh
swim-system-js $ bin/build.js watch -p ui:test -d -t
```

### Building documentation

```sh
swim-system-js $ bin/build.js doc -p system
```
