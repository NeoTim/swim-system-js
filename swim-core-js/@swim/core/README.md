`@swim/core` is the foundation framework on which the [`@swim/ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swim/ui)
and [`@swim/ux`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swim/ux) real-time user interface
frameworks are built.  `@swim/core` is written in TypeScript, but is designed
to be used from either TypeScript or JavaScript.

  [typedoc](http://docs.swim.ai/js/latest/modules/_swim_util.html)) –
  ordering, equality, and hashing; type conversions; iterators; builders; maps;
  caches; and assertions.

`@swim/core` has no external dependencies.

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/core` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/core/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/core/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script, which
bundles all `@swim/core` component libraries, can be found in
`node_modules/@swim/core/dist/main/swim-core.js`.

### Browser

Web applications can load `swim-core.js` directly from the Swim CDN.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.swim.ai/js/latest/swim-core.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

`@swim/core` can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.  All component libraries are re-exported,
in their entirety, from the top-level `@swim/core` namespace.

```typescript
import * as swim from "@swim/core";
```

### CommonJS/Node.js

`@swim/core` can also be used as a CommonJS in Node.js applications.
All component libraries are re-exported, in their entirety, from the
top-level `@swim/core` namespace.

```javascript
var swim = require("@swim/core");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-core.js` script adds all component
library exports to the global `swim` namespace.
