`@swim/ui` implements a massively real-time user interface toolkit.  Procedural
styling, and a unified view hierarchy, make it easy to consistently animate—and
efficiently render—mixed HTML, SVG, and Canvas components, enabling uniform
tweening of everything from HTML attributes, to CSS styles, SVG and Canvas
drawings, and custom parameters.

`@swim/ui` builds on the [`@swim/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swim/core)
framework; it has no additional dependencies.

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/ui` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/ui/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/ui/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script, which
bundles all `@swim/ui` component libraries, can be found in
`node_modules/@swim/ui/dist/main/swim-ui.js`.

### Browser

Web applications can load `swim-ui.js`, along with its `swim-core.js`
dependency, from the Swim CDN.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.swim.ai/js/latest/swim-core.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swim.ai/js/latest/swim-ui.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

`@swim/ui` can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.  All component libraries are re-exported,
in their entirety, from the top-level `@swim/ui` namespace.

```typescript
import * as swim from "@swim/ui";
```

### CommonJS

`@swim/ui` can also be used with CommonJS-compatible module systems.
All component libraries are re-exported, in their entirety, from the
top-level `@swim/ui` namespace.

```javascript
var swim = require("@swim/ui");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-ui.js` script adds all component
library exports to the global `swim` namespace.
